How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    clearly see the diff between the two versions instead of seraching the whole file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    easily see why and when you made diff changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    you choose when to mark a change as somethingyou want to see later. you can have some weird changes in the version control if it choooses

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    we treat the files in the repo as one project each file needs the other to run. google docs sees evertying as separately.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    you can see how many and what was changed since the last commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you can always revert back to working code

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
